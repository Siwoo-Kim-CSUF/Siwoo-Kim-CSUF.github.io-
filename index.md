### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was a favorite since it was comparable to a difficult topic I had previously struggled with: building a pyramid. I now fully understand the rows and coumns, and this lab provided me confidence that I have improved.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was very memorable because my partner and I created a date difference program, which we utilized to compute the date difference between my birthday and my partner Carson's. It was a number I didn't expect (a significant gap) and left me shocked.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2, was the final lab for the CPSC 120L. I particulary enjoyed part 2 of the lab, which involved producing an image using a pseudorandom intger. It's a little wild, but I enjoy the animated image that we created using a basic algorithm.
